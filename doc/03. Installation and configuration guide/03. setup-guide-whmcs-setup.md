## User Configuration:

- **Streaming bitrate limit:** An optional per-stream bitrate limit for all out of network devices. This is useful to prevent devices from requesting a higher bitrate than your internet connection can handle. This may result in increased CPU load on your server in order to transcode videos on the fly to a lower bitrate.
- **SyncPlay access:** The SyncPlay feature enables to sync playback with other devices. Select the level of access this user has to the SyncPlay
- **Remote control:** Remote control of shared devices (DLNA devices are considered shared until a user begins controlling them)
- **Media downloads:** Users can download media and store it on their devices. This is not the same as a sync feature. Book libraries require this enabled to function properly.
- **User sessions:** Set the maximum number of simultaneous user sessions. <div>A value of 0 will disable the feature.</div>
- ****Failed login attempts:**** Determine how many incorrect login tries can be made before lockout occurs. <div>A value of zero means inheriting the default of three tries for normal users and five for administrators. Setting this to -1 will disable the feature.</div>
- **Username prefix/Username suffix:** Necessary in order to generate a username for the service, in the format: **prefix&lt;cliet\_id&gt;-&lt;service\_id&gt;suffix**

### Allow playback (Restricting access to transcoding may cause playback failures in clients due to unsupported media formats)
